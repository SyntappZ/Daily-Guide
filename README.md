# Daily Guide

this is a personal project im making just to make the daily choices easier its made with html/css and vanilla javascript.
this is the first site that i done javascript on my own and not with help from tutorials, it really helped me understand arrays better and also im understanding if statments better to i understand that there is probably a lot of unessasary code in my javascript but its all good as im just building these to learn im sure my code will get better in time and i understands stuff better.
